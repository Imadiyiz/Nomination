Nomination game notes

Work through

4 player game, 52 cards, random starter, random first trump,
6 rounds with 8,7,6,6,7,8 cards.
Trump determined by previous round winner,
Points won by hand, +10 if called correctly
Bidding starts before round with left of dealer leading and unable to call numbers which makes totalling the amount of cards in hand possible e.g for a 6 card round with 4 players 1,2,3,0 can not be called as all 6 players can win a hand.

WALKTHROUGH LOGIC

PRE GAME:
GENERATE DECK
DETERMINE AMOUNT OF PLAYERS
DETERMINE DEALER
DEAL HANDS FOR PLAYERS
DETERMINE TRUMP
LOD CALLS FIRST
NEXT CALL X3
LAST CALL CANNOT EQUAL NO CARDS IN HAND

GAMEPLAY:
LOD PLAYS FIRST CARD
EACH PLAYER PLAYS A CARD
MUST PLAY SAME SUIT IF POSSIBLE
IF TRUMPED THEY WILL WIN HAND UNLESS HIGHER TRUMP PLAYED
WHOEVER WINS HAND, DEALS SUBSEQUENT HAND FIRST
REPEAT UNTIL NO MORE CARDS IN HAND
END ROUND AND WORKOUT WHO HAS CALLED CORRECTLY

PROGRAMMING THOUGHTS:

WHEN PROGRAMMING THE GAMEPLAY LOGIC MAKE SURE THE NAMES OF THE PLAYERS ARE NOT THE SAME

PUB/SUB ARCHITECTURE:

GAME_MANAGER publishes events such as reset_round(begins new round), end_round(calculates winner and adds scores),
main_menu(displays main menu), bidding_start(opens the bidding round), playing_start(Can play cards now)
create_game(instantiates a new game with new players)

main_menu - start_game, help, settings, credits
create_game !!
bidding_start 
bidding_end
playing_start
playing_end
end_round
repeat-until-end**
end_game - display winners and final scores

LOGIC FOR WINNING CARD

FIRST START WITH THE FRIST CARD
THIS IS THE WINNING CARD
SECOND CARD IS PLAYED
IF THIS CARD IS A TRUMP, CHECK TO SEE IF IT BEATS THE WINNING CARD.

NOW NEED TO TRY THE LOGIC FOR PLAYING AND PLACING CARDS, ALL THE FUNCTIONALITY TO PLAY
THE GAME IS READY AND JUST NEEDS TO BE PUT INTO ORDER AND DISPLAYED IN A USER FRIENDLY WAY

THIS INCLUDES PUTTING ** NEXT TO WINNING PLAYER HANDS, SCOREBOARD READINGS AFTER SCORES
WHO IS OVER WHO IS UNDER. THIS WILL ALL BE MUCH EASIER WITH A PYGAME UI.
